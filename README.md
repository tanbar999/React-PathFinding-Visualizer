# How to use

💜 Using [W,A,S,D] can move the starting point marked by {S}.

💜 Using [⬆️,➡️,⬇️,⬅️] can move the destination point marked by {D}.

💜 Press Left mouse button and drag to create walls which would act like obstructions for pathfinding algorithms.

💜 Select the given path-finding algorithms and Hit Go.

💜 You can Reset just the Path that was calculated and watch other pathfinding algorithms.

💜 You can Reset All  the Path and the walls i.e. CLEAN SLATE.

-> There are different algorithms that can be selected just by pressing on it and once you are ready with your grid just hit GO.
-> You can jusr RESET PATHS to see how other algorithms performs in the same situation.

# Special "Spiral" traversal

💜 This algorithm is new and traverses the grid in a spiral form.

💜 It assumes that the grid is infinite.

💜 If there is no way, it will move out of the grid and calculate the neares entrance and will find the destination.

💜 Its very hard to block.
